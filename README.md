# Quick Dice Rolling Application

**Author:** Maximus Barraza (Github: X86-Point5)
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** April 30, 2025
**Development Environment:** Windows

## Purpose

This project is a simple console-based Dice Rolling application developed in Python. It serves as a documentation of early learning progress in Python, demonstrating basic input handling, loops, and use of the `random` module.

This application is intended as a documentation of early progress and is specifically designed for a Windows environment.

## Features

* Allows the user to specify the number of faces on a die.
* Allows the user to specify how many times the die should be rolled.
* Provides basic input validation for the number of faces (must be a positive integer greater than 1) and number of rolls (must be a positive integer greater than 0).
* Outputs the result of each individual dice roll.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your Windows system.
2.  Save the `app.py` file (the Dice Roller application) to a directory. Let's assume this directory is named `DiceRollerApp`.
3.  Open a command prompt or PowerShell.
4.  Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:
    ```bash
    cd path\to\your\DiceRollerApp
    ```
    (Replace `path\to\your\DiceRollerApp` with the actual path to the directory).
5.  Run the application using the command:
    ```bash
    py app.py
    ```
    (Or `python app.py` if `py` is not aliased to your Python 3 interpreter).
6.  Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the number of faces and rolls.

## Windows Specificity

While this particular application does not use Windows-specific OS commands (like `cls` or `pause`), it was developed and tested primarily in a Windows environment as part of documenting early progress.
